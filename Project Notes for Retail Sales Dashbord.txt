Project Notes for Retail Sales Dashboard:

1. Data Integration:
   - The raw retail sales dataset (>2GB) was loaded into PostgreSQL.
   - Joined with store_cities and product_hierarchy using SQL.
   - A representative sample (<100MB) was exported for use in Power BI.

2. Data Inspection:
   - Python (pandas) was used to quickly inspect column headers due to the large file size.

3. Data Cleaning & Transformation:
   - Power Query in Power BI was used for additional cleaning (changing data types, removing unnecessary columns).
   - The final dataset contains 14 key columns essential for analysis.

4. Dashboard Development:
   - The dashboard is built in Power BI, featuring KPIs, trend lines, and interactive slicers.
   - Key insights include trends over time, store type performance, and product cluster analysis.

Future Enhancements:
   - Explore dynamic tooltips for more detailed drill-downs.
   - Add additional metrics like YoY growth and advanced segmentation.
